### Marking a method as virtual means you can override it in derived classes, but you don't have to. If you mark a method as abstract, you are subsequently forced by the compiler to override it in any derived classes.

### The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class.For example, this method can be overridden by any class that inherits it.
