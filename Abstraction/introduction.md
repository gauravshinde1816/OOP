## Abstraction:

- An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.

- `Encapsulation` is a to achieve "information hiding" so, following your example, you don't "need to know the internal working of the mobile phone to operate" with it. You have an interface to use the device behaviour without knowing implementation details.

- `Abstraction` on the other side, can be explained as the capability to use the same interface for different objects. Different implementations of the same interface can exist. Details are hidden by encapsulation.

- `Abstraction` is a
 concept, which is allowed by `encapsulation`.
